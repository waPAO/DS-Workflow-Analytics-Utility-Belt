* Data Science: The study of data in short, but moreso the ability to use and create techniques that allow you to extract information (significant or not) from small to large pieces of data.
* Data Analysis: The process of evaluating and understanding data through statistical and logical techniques in order to represent these discoveries though visualiztions.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory Data Anlysis is a way of summarizing main points and characteristics of datasets through evaluations of the data and simple visualizations.
* Hypotheses Tests: Are used to analyze and varify whether a claim you make is deemed true. You would prove these hypotheses through a series of data science and data analysis techniques to help back your research.
* Basic Probablilty: Evaluates the real word and its data through a simple and rudimentary lens. It covers that events occur independently and looking at events with respect to others is mainly non-deterministic.
* Conditional Probablility: Unlike basic probability, conditional probability entirely revolves around the liklihood of event occuring based on the occurence of another.
* Summary Statistics: Stats that identify and summarize a dataset quantitatively Ex: mean median, mode, range, standard deviation, etc.
* Uniform Distributions: Simple distributions that are extremely rare in nature where all possible values in a dataset occur merely the same with equivalent frequency.

* Binomial Distributions: Discrete forms of events where there are two discretized outcomes. This distribution is closely resembled by a bell-curve with the more data that is passed.
* Central Limit Theorem: Allows us to treat any data distribution as a normal distribution based on the dataset's standard deviation and mean.
